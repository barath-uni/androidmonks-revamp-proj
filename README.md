### What does this repository do do?
Hosts the post/article files for the website. Running on the edge, so static rendering takes place. 


### Current Status
Currently working on fixing the markdown converter to convert my html files for easier porting. 


### Next step
Use it as a dev environment to test out the web-app connectivity(Should be running only internally)
