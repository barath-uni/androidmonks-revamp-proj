## Imagepicker Widget in Flutter ‚Äì Gallery Made easy

[Imagepicker widget in Flutter](https://androidmonks.com/imagepicker-flutter/) makes the life so much easy by bridging Photo gallery in Flutter. In this article we will read more about using the ImagePicker Plugin/Widget to create a good gallery like app.

Even before we jump into that, we will be requiring the one important plugin ‚Äì [**image\_picker**](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker)


```
dependencies:
**image\_picker: ^0.6.1+4**
```
This will also require you to add an import statement in the main.dart(or whichever is the main file).


```
import 'package:image\_picker/image\_picker.dart';
```
Once these two are added, incase the application has to be used for IOS, make sure to add the following changes in¬†**info.plist** file.

* **NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription**¬†‚Äì describe why your app needs permission for the photo library. This is called¬†*Privacy ‚Äì Photo Library Usage Description*¬†in the visual editor.
* **NSCameraUsageDescription**¬†‚Äì describe why your app needs access to the camera. This is called¬†*Privacy ‚Äì Camera Usage Description*¬†in the visual editor.
* **NSMicrophoneUsageDescription**¬†‚Äì describe why your app needs access to the microphone, if you intend to record videos. This is called¬†*Privacy ‚Äì Microphone Usage Description* in the visual editor.

### Image Picker Widget ‚Äì Basics

To make use of this ImagePicker widget, just call the class¬†[**ImagePicker**](https://androidmonks.com/imagepicker-flutter/). There are two possibilities from this class.

* **Choose** **an** **Image or Choose a Video**
* **Choose one of the above from a Gallery or a Camera Source directly**

The above are possible through the method callbacks.

* **ImagePicker.pickImage()** with source as¬†**ImageSource.gallery or ImageSource.camera**
* or **ImagePicker.pickVideo()**with the sources as mentioned above.

Both the calls above mentioned are async calls(Read more about FutureBuilder Widget and Asynchronous operations). Hence, it requires to **setState()** on the image/video that is selected.

The ImagePicker.<source call> returns a file location of the image/video. It is upto us to load the Image using the Image.file() call.

All of this are pieced together in the below example code. To know more about it read it in the next section.

### ImagePicker Widget ‚Äì Example Application

The below example app creates a [Image Picker button](https://androidmonks.com/imagepicker-flutter/) which lets you to choose either a Image from gallery or directly from the Camera.

The next section contains the app images. Also find code explanation below.


```
import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image\_picker/image\_picker.dart';

void main() => runApp(ImagePickerApp());

class ImagePickerApp extends StatelessWidget {
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
return MaterialApp(
title: 'Sample Imagepicker Widget',
home: ImagePickerWidget(),
);
}
}

class ImagePickerWidget extends StatefulWidget {
ImagePickerWidget({Key key}) : super(key: key);

@override
\_ImagePickerWidgetState createState() => \_ImagePickerWidgetState();
}

class \_ImagePickerWidgetState extends State {

File \_image;
@override
void initState() {
super.initState();
}

void open\_camera()
async {
var image = await ImagePicker.pickImage(source: ImageSource.camera);
setState(() {
\_image = image;
});

}
void open\_gallery()
async {
var image = await ImagePicker.pickImage(source: ImageSource.gallery);
setState(() {
\_image = image;
});
}
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
return Scaffold(
appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Sample Imagepicker Widget"),
backgroundColor: Colors.black45,),
body: Center(
child: Container(
child: Column(
children: [
Container(
color: Colors.black12,
