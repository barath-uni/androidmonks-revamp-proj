 ## Baradwaj Varadharajan

Hello! I have been an ardent developer ever since i first got my PC when i was 12 Years old. I Started out as a Web developer but later picked up Mobile as my most favourite platform to develop applications.

I am currently a Masters student in Artificial Intelligence from University of Amsterdam. I also spend my other half of the day creating and learning different technology. There are a lot of projects/products that I have built(check them on github) & additionally also write and make videos on Android and Other Programming Languages! If you wish to connect, hit me up on LinkedIn.
